Class 7: EC2 basics

Task==building an Amazon Linux EC2 with a custom script

Template==https://github.com/XDE77/bmc5/blob/main/ec2scrpit

Steps
1.	Create a new security group (do not use default, allows resources to have access to areas inside/outside of AWS)
2.	Create EC2
3.	Copy public DNS make it into a usable link and post link into the chat

Notes:
= Keypair connects a user’s computer to the AWS EC2 via secure shell
=make sure to type http:// before any links are made
	Example – http://ec2.3-17-6-2.us-east-2.compute.amazonnews.com
=tags are useful for organization as well as tracking resource usage across the organization, essential for the office.

What I learned today (for resume): Made a frond end server.
